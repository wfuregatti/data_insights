Set of codes related to Data Analysis to be posted on Linkedin

This repository was created to save and provide access to pieces of code regarding Data Analysis. 
The languages and technologies used here will mostly be the ones that I have experience on and also the fragments will deal with challenges I faced over my background experiences.

Database development, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, SQL, Python, Power BI and Qlik View will always be around.
